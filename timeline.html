        <h2> "CAT" (Course Aggregator Tool) Project Timeline 2013</h2>

<p> Garrett Disco, Noah Apthorpe, Luke Paulsen, Jocelyn Tang, Natalie Weires </p>
<hr/>
<p> 2/17 First group meeting. Discussed project ideas. </p>
<hr/>
<p> 2/19 Lunch with Prof. Kernighan. Decided on building a web app course aggregator / timeline project. </p>
<hr/>
<p> 2/24 Second meeting. Decided on basic features of "CAT". CAT will display the history of a course, with each instance of the course as some kind of unit. Information we will display for each instance: course reviews (including ratings in each category); professor; size; book expenses. Classes will also be searchable and rankable with this data. Discussed some practical issues of doing this (scraping registrar site, maintaining course info in database dealing with writing sems / changing course numbers, etc.). Tentatively decided to use Django + Mongo on backend and host on AWS. Plan for the following week: set up Github, set up & start design doc, prepare for meeting with Kernighan, and get in contact with OIT and/or Registrar. </p>
<hr/>
<p> 2/25 Github up (lpaulsen333/cat) and working. Group members added.</p>
<hr/>
<p> 2/28 Design document posted on Github.</p>
<hr/>
<p> 3/3 Third meeting. Produced Overview and Milestones sections of the design document. Determined the "core" of what the project is about (making it easy for students to search, visualize, and compare information about courses). Established basic plan for working on the project. Discussed details of backend setup.</p>
<hr/>
<p> 3/9 Minimal "Hello World" Django site posted on Github (can be run on localhost).</p>
<hr/>
<p> 3/10 Fourth meeting. Produced Functionality, Design, and Risks sections of the design document. Developed basic design for frontend: based on "boxes" each displaying course data for a particular semester. Boxes start out as search screens, then become search results, then become course data displays after clicking on a search result. Ability to tab between each mode on a box. Tentatively determined group roles: Natalie and Jocelyn to focus on backend / scraping, Luke to focus on Django framework and logic, Garrett and Noah to focus on frontend. For this week: Set up AWS, finish design document.</p>
<hr/>
<p> 3/11 Timeline posted as HTML. </p>
<hr/>
<p> 3/12 Initial meeting with USG. Discovered that they've already been discussing the idea of redesigning the registrar page and SCORE. Discussed how their plan and our app can work together. Exchanged contact info with USG IT chairs.</p>
<hr/>
<p> 3/15 Design document finalized and submitted. </p>
<hr/>
<p> 3/19 Database building and access started with data from OIT web feed. </p>
<hr/>
<p> 3/20 Course data scraped from Registrar website and stored in database. </p>
<hr/>
<p> 3/21 Course data from MongoDB queried, accessed and displayed using Django. </p>
<hr/>
<p> 3/23 jQuery and jQueryUI set up, jQuery search interface demo running. </p>
<image src="timeline/UIDemo.png">
<hr/>
<p> 3/24 jQuery integrated with Django. We can submit forms to a special Django view and get results back using jQuery. </p>
<hr/>
<p> 3/26 Basic Django setup demo'd to TA. </p>
<hr/>
<p> 3/31 Group meeting. Discussed structure of UI and changed design based on Garrett's and Noah's ideas. Scheduled meetings to implement the new design. Basic version of the unified search bar working. </p>
<hr/>
<p> 4/2 Basic UI layout implemented with jQuery / CSS and integrated with Django. </p>
<hr/>
<p> 4/3 Improved UI: search bar bugs fixed, scrolling display, correct professor data. Course information from a query is just concatenated at the end of the list of course titles.</p>
<image src="timeline/CatV1.png">
<hr/>
<p> 4/5 Another UI overhaul with searching, scrolling, and course information demo'd to TA. Ability to add courses to a cart (that the site forgets when you leave the page). Advanced Search just brings up an empty div.</p>
<image src="timeline/CatV2.png">
<hr/>
<p> 4/7 Made decisions on proposed features and on protocol for client / server interaction. Ability to view course reviews and past semesters; advanced search; multiple sorting options; keyword search; and professor ratings will be included. Course scheduling, textbook information, graphs, and analytics on grade distribution will not. First request to server will return full results list and data for the current semester; viewing previous semesters, viewing reviews, and modifying the cart will be served with additional requests. Priorities: scraping course reviews, adding list of semesters to database; navigating reviews and old semesters, re-structuring UI.</p>
<hr/>
<p> 4/10 Updated the database code to intelligently keep track of which semesters a course was offered, and only display the most recent offering. </p>
<hr/>
<p> 4/12 Successful storage of course cart in DB, ability to add course reviews to the DB, animation tweaks.</p>
<hr/>
<p> 4/14 new UI skin, new color scheme, scrollbars </p>
<image src="timeline/CatV3.png">
<p>And this is what our advanced search currently looks like: </p>
<image src="timeline/AdvancedSearchV2.png">
<hr/>
<p> 4/15 bug fixes, adding categories to advanced search </p>
<image src="timeline/AdvancedSearchV3.png">
<hr/>
<p> 4/18 Detail view now contains *almost* all categories of data </p>
<hr/>
<p> 4/19 Keyword search working </p>
<hr/>
<p> 4/20 major UI overhaul, added spinner, cart icon. The spinner is kind of hard to get a screenshot of ('cause CAT is wicked fast, of course), but it appears right to the left of the search bar.</p>
<p> Here's the view when you first access the page </p>
<image src="timeline/CatV4.png">
<p> And this is what a search looks like: </p>
<image src="timeline/CatV4Search.png">
<hr/>
<p> 4/21 Can now fetch something that looks maybe like review data and display it in UI, also can display some basic analytics on cart courses *EDIT: We ended up scrapping this idea for the sake of time*</p>
<hr/>
<p> 4/22 Lots of UI improvements: replacing html in course data, refining semester menu, cart improvements, showing/hiding courses from previous semesters, toggling course reviews, begin work on tabluating review summary data.</p>

<hr/>
<p> 4/24 CAS login working! OIT was very responsive about getting our site on the CAS whitelist, this came together in about 24 hours.</p>
<hr/>
<p> 4/26 Lots of functionality improvements. You can now search by date/time (i.e. Mon 10:00am), you can actually log out of CAS, and pdf-only is an option in Advanced Search.
<hr/>
<p> 4/30 We can now graph review data! Here's what the "reviews" view now looks like (notice the additional CSS polish as well):</p>
<image src="timeline/graph.png">
<p> We're also now displaying a colored circle as an indicator of overall rating in the serach results. The color of the circle (on a scale of red to green) is computed as a weighted average of ratings over time. Hoverover text gives the numerical weighted average, on a scale of 0 to 5:</p>
<image src="timeline/indicator.png">
<hr/>
<p> 5/1 Factored login/logout features into a top bar, similar to ICE: </p>
<image src="timeline/top_bar.png">
<hr/>
<p>5/2 Refactored class list into a table, also made a lot of improvements on user feedback and usability. For example, if you search for a course that is hidden in a previous semester, an error message now directs you to select the "show previous semesters" button. </p>
<hr/>
<p>5/3 Starting beta tests today! Finally decided on a background! We don't anticipate any major changes from here.</p>
