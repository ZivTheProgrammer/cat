<h1> CAT Final Report </h1>
<p> Noah Apthorpe, Garrett Disco, Luke Paulsen, Jocelyn Tang, Natalie Weires </p>
<p> Princeton University, COS 333, Spring 2013 (TA: Hao Wu) </p>

<p> How did your milestones go? </p>
<p> pretty well </p>

<p> What was your experience with design, interfaces, testing, etc.? </p>
<p> </p>

<p> What surprises, pleasant or otherwise, did you encounter on the way? </p>
<p> professor = keyword? (“Christian”) </p>
<p> trouble with hosting/CAS? </p>

<p> What choices did you make that worked out well or badly? </p>
<!--<p> starting early (thanks to natski) was good!</p>-->
<p> We started our project early, getting the basic database built over spring break. This included defining an interface through which the database could be accessed, which let us start building the middle and front layers of the site while still making changes to how the database was structured and built. Similarly, we split up the various components of the project in a way that let us work indivually or in pairs on sections separately, but so that the pieces worked together well.

<p> We didn't use Twitter Bootstrap, which gave us more freedom in the design of the site... </p>

<p> At the very beginning of the project, we talked to USG about making our site a TigerApp. While they were excited and wanted to be involved, actually getting our project hosted with them didn't happen quickly enough for us to keep making progress, so we ended up hosting on an Amazon EC2 server. While there are plans to eventually move CAT to USG servers, trying to make this happen during the semester didn't work out. </p>

<p>  What would you like to do if there were more time? How would you do things differently next time? </p>

<p> What should next year's class learn from your experience? Imagine that you are writing this document for your (friendly!) boss or professor and want to explain what you learned that could be applied to the next project.</p>
<p> start early! (like over spring break) </p>
