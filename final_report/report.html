<h1> CAT Final Report </h1>

<p> Princeton University, COS 333, Spring 2013 (TA: Hao Wu) </p>

<p> How did your milestones go? </p>
<p> pretty well </p>

<p> What was your experience with design, interfaces, testing, etc.? </p>
<p> </p>

<p> What surprises, pleasant or otherwise, did you encounter on the way? </p>
<p> professor = keyword? (“Christian”) </p>
<p> trouble with hosting/CAS? </p>

<p> What choices did you make that worked out well or badly? </p>
<!--<p> starting early (thanks to natski) was good!</p>-->
<p> We started our project early, getting the basic database built over spring break. This included defining an interface through which the database could be accessed, which let us start building the middle and front layers of the site while still making changes to how the database was structured and built. Similarly, we split up the various components of the project in a way that let us work indivually or in pairs on sections separately, but so that the pieces worked together well.

<p> Unlike many groups, we decided not to use Twitter Bootstrap to design our app's style and layout. This gave us more freedom to design features in novel ways. For example, no other search engine we have observed brings back search results on the left and detail views of search results on the right. We think that this is one of our app's best features, as it allows you to search, browse results, and read registrar and review data all without reloading the page.</p>

<p> At the very beginning of the project, we talked to USG about making our site a TigerApp. While they were excited and wanted to be involved, actually getting our project hosted with them didn't happen quickly enough for us to keep making progress, so we ended up hosting on an Amazon EC2 server. While there are plans to eventually move CAT to USG servers, trying to make this happen during the semester didn't work out. </p>

<p> What would you like to do if there were more time? How would you do things differently next time? </p>
<p> One of the most frustrating parts of designing CAT was not getting to include all the features we had in mind. We overestimated how long it would take to implement what we consider our "core platform," namely, the user interface, the search functionality, and the ability to see graphs of reviews. A major feature we did not have time to implement was an "Analyze" feature for courses in the cart. This feature would have analyzed Registrar data to compile statistics on the total workload required to complete all of the courses in the cart. For example, we might have reported on the number of midterms, finals, pages of reading per week, Dean's Date papers, etc, and displayed these results in a slick graph.</p>

<p> We would also have liked to implement connectivity with ICE in the form of a button that would populate ICE with the courses in your cart. This feature would really make CAT the go-to place for course searching by providing easy access to the current most popular course-related app. </p>

<p> If we had the chance to do it again, one of the first things we would do is organize our code better. We started with a demo jQuery website with all of the javascript in a file called index.js, and the css in a file called index.css. Somehow in the process of turning that jQuery demo into CAT, we never broke up those files, such that index.js is now about 600 lines long, index.css is about 800 lines long, and both of them are essentially unordered collections of miscelaneous functions and classes that we added as we went along. Keeping these files better organized would have made later development and bug fixing much easier.</p>

<p> We also would put more thought into styling the app. Consistent with our choice not to use Twitter Bootstrap, we focused first and foremost on functionality and layout, and thus left the "minor details" of fonts, color, background, etc. up to whoever happend to be working on that feature at the time. Do to differences in taste and the lack of a framework like Bootstrap, we ended up with some inconsistent styling that had to be resolved through much debate within the group, and a final product that lacks the polished look of a Bootstrap-driven site.</p> 

<p> What should next year's class learn from your experience? Imagine that you are writing this document for your (friendly!) boss or professor and want to explain what you learned that could be applied to the next project.</p>
<p> start early! (like over spring break) </p>
