<h1> CAT Final Report </h1>
<p> Noah Apthorpe, Garrett Disco, Luke Paulsen, Jocelyn Tang, Natalie Weires </p>
<p> Princeton University, COS 333, Spring 2013 (TA: Hao Wu) </p>


<h2> Milestones </h2>
<p> We generally kept up well with our milestones, although some of them were completed in a different order than we expected. A brief summary of our goals and what we actually accomplished follows: </p>
<h3> March 22 </h3>
<p> Over spring break, our goal was to get MongoDB set up and working, get AWS set up and working, and begin scraping data from the Registrar. (Django was already set up and working on localhost when we finalized our timeline.) Natalie successfully set up MongoDB and the scraping system, and defined much of the database structure (based on the structure of Registrar information). However, we did not get AWS set up for a long time after this. This was partially because the Django runserver was very effective for development and testing, and partially because we were expecting to be hosted by OIT and/or Tigerapps (which has not yet come through).</p>
<h3> March 29 </h3>
<p> For this date, our goal was to have the whole structure of the site up and working in a minimal fashion: Mongo, Django, and Javascript all interacting correctly, and the database structure (all information needed for any given course) clearly defined. We met this goal easily, with the exception of setting up the database to handle course reviews (which are provided on a separate website from the Registrar website and turned out to be quite challenging to access). By the end of this week, we had a working search interface where we could type in a course subject and/or number and get a clickable list of results and course data back from the database, which went considerably beyond what we had expected to accomplish. </p>
<h3> April 5 </h3>
<p> For this date, our goal was to scrape all available course data from the Registrar and display it on the frontend (which was already accomplished, except for reviews, the week before). Additionally, our goal was to decide on a final design for the frontend and be able to search, filter, and/or rank courses by any category. This proved to be a less realistic goal. Although we made major frontend improvements during this week and expanded the kinds of queries that the search bar could handle, we did not achieve full functionality on this front until later. </p>
<h3> April 12 </h3>
<p> For this date, our goal was to implement the CAS login wall, show the search bar and results on the frontend, and handle difficult corner cases when scraping courses. Of these, the last two were already more or less complete by this point, and the first remained an unsolved problem unitl two weeks later. What we did accomplish this week was to add course review scraping to the database and add the ability to save courses in a "cart" across sessions. This is also the point at which we made a lot of the final decisions regarding the UI design and the protocol for UI/Django interaction. </p>
<h3> April 19 </h3>
<p> For this date, our goal was to implement interactive features (such as tabbing between semesters, choosing which data to display, switching between multiple courses at once, and saving user data) on the frontend, and to test the system's protection against basic attacks. Because we had by this point significantly modified our original frontend design, several of these goals were no longer relevant (we didn't plan to display multiple courses at once or dynamically modify which data was displayed), and saved user data and tabbing were already a reality. We didn't carry out any formal tests of our system's security at this point, but between Django's built-in protections and the use of CatDB to access Mongo, we were confident that it would be difficult to attack our database. During this week, we continued to increase the number of categories of data that could be displayed and searched by.</p>
<h3> April 26 </h3>
<p> For this date, our goal was to finalize the frontend navigation system and begin implementing additional, "cool" features. We did in fact do our final major UI overhaul during this week, which gave us much of the current look of the site. This is also the point at which we added a way to display course reviews, which was the one major piece of information that the site had been missing, and finally implemented the CAS login system in order to protect the review data. The one major "additional" feature we considered adding was an "analyze" button to get combined data about courses in the cart; this ended up getting scrapped, since it was unlikely to be sufficiently useful given the amount of work we would be able to put into it. </p>
<h3> May 3 </h3>
<p> For this date, our goal was to finish making the frontend styles and the additional features. That is pretty much what we did: we added the course-review graphing and color-coding systems, added a top bar with intuitive login/logout functionality, added a few more search queries and improved some others, improved the display of course data and review data, and finally decided on what background to use (which had been a major point of contention. By this point, nearly all major features were implemented and working correctly, and we deployed the system for beta testing.</p>
<h3> May 10 </h3>
<p> By this date, we planned to finalize the software and prepare the demo and presentation. This was our presentation date, so clearly we accomplished these goals (although a few bugs in the software were fixed after the demo). As of this date, we had a complete database going back to 2010, a fully functional searching and ranking system, a system for displaying all available course data, and even our own domain (princetoncat.org). This was effectively the end of the CAT development process and at this point we have met all of our major goals for the program. </p>

<p> What was your experience with design, interfaces, testing, etc.? </p>
<p> </p>

<p> What surprises, pleasant or otherwise, did you encounter on the way? </p>
<p> professor = keyword? (“Christian”) </p>
<p> trouble with hosting/CAS? </p>

<p> What choices did you make that worked out well or badly? </p>
<p> starting early (thanks to natski) was good!</p>

<p>  What would you like to do if there were more time? How would you do things differently next time? </p>
<p> analyze button </p>

<p> What should next year's class learn from your experience? Imagine that you are writing this document for your (friendly!) boss or professor and want to explain what you learned that could be applied to the next project.</p>
<p> start early! (like over spring break) </p>
