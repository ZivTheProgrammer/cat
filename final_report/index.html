    <p> CAT is a redesign of Princeton's Registrar website that empowers students to make informed decisions when choosing courses through one clean, accessible interface. It makes course data and SCORE reviews available faster than ever with a smart search bar that accepts natural, Google-style queries for specific attributes like day and time, distribution area, and grading option. The data is presented in the familiar Registrar style, supplemented with statistics from course reviews and graphs that show how a course's ratings change over time. A shopping cart feature allows easy access to favorite courses, making CAT not only a search engine, but also a platform for comparing courses rapidly. Its ability to aggregeate so much data gives it great potential for growth, making it a promising prototype for a TigerApp that will change the way Princetonians look for courses. </p>

    <p> Our system can be accessed online at <a href ="http://princetoncat.org">princetoncat.org</a> or at <a href="http://54.214.3.204">54.214.3.204</a>.
    A valid Princeton netid and password is required for CAS authentication.
