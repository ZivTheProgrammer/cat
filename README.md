A project for COS 333 by Noah Apthorpe, Garrett Disco, Luke Paulsen, Jocelyn Tang, and Natalie Weires


Database stuff:
If you want to build the database on your machine, you need Python version 2.7
(at least), MongoDB, and pymongo. To build the db, have a mongo server running
('mongod' from the command line), then call 'python scrapeClasses.py build'.
For now, it just gets a small subset of all the courses.
