\section{Overview}
\par The Course Aggregator Tool is an online platform for viewing and querying Princeton course information available at various OIT and Registrar sites. This will help Princeton undergraduates make course selection and scheduling decisions, including long-term course planning. The site is different from other tools such as ICE and the Registrar site in that it will allow easy visualization of all available data on a course, make it easier to compare and rank courses, and provide historical data on older semesters of a course, but it is not designed to provide calendar-style scheduling the way ICE is.
\par CAT will provide a graphical interface that will make it easy for users to get a sense of what a course is like and select what information they want to see. It will also provide a way to compare two (or possibly more) courses side-by-side. The course data being displayed will include: professors, class size, class times, ratings in each category, written course reviews, P/D/F status, and textbook costs. It will be possible to search for, rank, and filter courses by any of these categories, either over the whole university or by department or distribution requirement. We will also include a system for rating course reviews "up" or "down" for its helpfulness.
\par CAT will be built with Python/Django and hosted on Amazon AWS. We will scrape course data periodically (e.g. once per semester) from the Registrar website and store it in a Mongo database. We are still deciding on what to use for the frontend, but it is likely to involve heavy use of Javascript/CSS and/or tools built on top of them.

\section{Functionality}
CAT has several different possible use cases, all of which involve a comparison of multiple courses.
\par Use case 1: A user wants to find a class fitting a particular kind of description (e.g. "find a large LA class that is well-reviewed and offered after 11 AM"). The user goes to the CAT homepage, which has a prominent search bar in which all of these parameters can be put in (either a selection of fields, or a single text bar with smart interpretation, or both). Once the user has entered the search parameters, a results page is displayed with the best matching courses, from which the user can select one or more courses to view the full data for.
\par Use case 2: A user is only considering a few courses (e.g. COS 333 and COS 402) and wants to compare their ratings in detail. The user opens both courses in the full-data view mode (by typing their codes into a search bar) and compares them side-by-side in terms of lecture rating, assignment rating, and overall course recommendation rating (all of these can be selected to display in the full-data view mode).
\par Use case 3: A user is browsing courses and is considering what to take in future semesters. The user puts in very general search parameters (e.g. all COS classes) and looks at classes from the result list one at a time. When viewing courses, the user uses the "timeline" option, which brings up the current (or most recent) semester of the course as well as past semesters. Then user can then view how course ratings, class size, readings, and so on have changed over time.
\par Core functionality that will be required:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Obtain course data from Registrar website
\item Search from homepage by any category, including ranking courses
\item Display one or more courses from search results in full-data view
\item Add additional courses to view within full-data view
\item Extend a single semester to a timeline within full-data view
\item Choose which data to display for courses within full-data view
\end{enumerate}

\section{Milestones}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Set up site on AWS (i.e. have "Hello World" working)
\item Set up backend on AWS, send data back and forth
\item Get in contact with OIT / Registrar
\item Define database structure (all categories we will need)
\item Scrape one semester worth of course data
\item Display single semester data in bare-bones format
\item Scrape multiple semesters and display all at once
\item Search, filter, and rank by any category
\item Decide on frontend design specs for course view (move earlier?)
\item Decide on frontend design specs for search view
\par [No particular order from here on out]
\item Implement frontend design specs for search view
\item Implement frontend design specs for course view
\item Implement ranking system for course reviews
\item Implement textual analysis of course reviews
\item Implement future semester predictions
\item Implement CAS login wall
\item Deploy for alpha test
\item Deploy for beta test
\item Deploy for demo
\end{enumerate}
