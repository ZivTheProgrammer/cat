This is just a file of stuff we think about that needs to be done. These are mostly little things that anyone
could do in their spare time:

/--------BUGS----------/

**AHH SAME SCROLLING BUG WITH THE GRADIENT FIX THIS NAUWGH!!!**

**If you delete the text in the search field, stop the search?**

**searching 'npdf' returns ART 260, which is not npdf**

**Put pdf options in Advanced Search**

**ENG 201 has been offered in past semesters, not showing**

** Hey Natalie, I really like how COM 318 looks, specially that little question mark in Bola?o that's in the
database. Good job!**

**Still not scraping all courses**

Fixed? **Scraping formats for distribution requirements and pdf stuff. So far, "na, npdf" doesn't seem to work.**

**See folder cat/bugScreenshots for screenshots of bugs that need to be fixed. If fixed, don't delete the files, just note that it's resolved in the README**

**FOR TESTING REVIEWS**
There's a freaky review for AAS 201, from 2006 for Robert Fredin, that's just "aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa" and it makes ICE look pretty bad.

Show crosslistings in results list

top/bottom of scroll bar (are great!)

shopping carts (are also nice...)

Make the black less black.

Make scrollbar present always.

Add a logout button.

On the drop-down of semesters- make sure they are in chronological order. Most are now, I think since that's how they're in the database. (I can also make sure they stay sorted in the db, if that's

/------Features--------/
Include class number. The thing you need to enter on SCORE to find the stupid course.

What about this thing that appears on some courses?
     ENROLLMENT BY APPLICATION OR INTERVIEW. DEPARTMENTAL PERMISSION REQUIRED.

The courses that are returned from the search need to be sorted.  If we want to be like the registrar, they should 
be sorted first be subject, e.g. COS, and then stably sorted by number, e.g. 109. 

Should searching for "pdf" return pdf-only courses or all courses that are pdf-able (i.e. most courses)

Searching by time should work.  Question: If a user searches an hour, say "11:00" or "11am" or "11AM" or "11:00 am" etc., should the search should return all classes that start anytime within that hour, or only classes that start exactly at that time?
--Any time within that hour. That's what the Registrar does.

Distinguish between professors and preceptors. (This is a scraping issue first, then a display issue.)

Can we make it so that if there is only one search result (especially if I search for a specific course, e.g. "COS 333"), it gets opened up on the right side automatically?
FIXED

Database scraping: a few classes aren't getting added for some reason. In particular, CBE 504 (and a few others) for term 1132.

/------Feepers---------/
Need to format detail view and make it include:
   Links from professor names to contact info, eg:
   	 http://registrar.princeton.edu/course-offerings/dirinfo.xml?uid=960019894
     
Will it be possible to search by grade percentages, i.e. "<50% final" or "no oral presentation" or ">60% papers"?  Even if this
    just worked for finals, midterms, and papers, this would be /SUPER/ cool.  Some courses don't include this data, so they could
    just be ignored for this type of searches.
    
/-----COMPLETED--------/
**Should not be able to spam requests if search hasn't changed**
