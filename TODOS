This is just a file of stuff we think about that needs to be done. These are mostly little things that anyone
could do in their spare time:

/--------BUGS----------/

HUGE bug: remove commas from tokens!!

**Get rid of empty reviews**

**If you delete the text in the search field, stop the search?**

**searching 'npdf' returns ART 260, which is not npdf**
    it was in past semesters

Fixed? **Scraping formats for distribution requirements and pdf stuff. So far, "na, npdf" doesn't seem to work.**
    Any specific examples?

**See folder cat/bugScreenshots for screenshots of bugs that need to be fixed. If fixed, don't delete the files, just note that it's resolved in the README**

**FOR TESTING REVIEWS**
There's a freaky review for AAS 201, from 2006 for Robert Fredin, that's just "aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa" and it makes ICE look pretty bad.

Fonts

top/bottom of scroll bar (are great!)

shopping carts (are also nice...)

Make scrollbar present always.

/------Features--------/

Label ratings graphs with professors.

Format reviews better (show/hide review text, get professor name from left side)

Make the labels on the graph hyperlink to the reviews.

What about this thing that appears on some courses?
     ENROLLMENT BY APPLICATION OR INTERVIEW. DEPARTMENTAL PERMISSION REQUIRED.

The courses that are returned from the search need to be sorted.  If we want to be like the registrar, they should 
be sorted first be subject, e.g. COS, and then stably sorted by number, e.g. 109. 

Should searching for "pdf" return pdf-only courses or all courses that are pdf-able (i.e. most courses)

Searching by time should work.  Question: If a user searches an hour, say "11:00" or "11am" or "11AM" or "11:00 am" etc., should the search should return all classes that start anytime within that hour, or only classes that start exactly at that time?
--Any time within that hour. That's what the Registrar does.

Seach by name of department (e.g. 'math' instead of 'MAT')

If this is the first semester a course has been offered, the reviews page is completely empty

/------Feepers---------/
Need to format detail view and make it include:
   Links from professor names to contact info, eg:
   	 http://registrar.princeton.edu/course-offerings/dirinfo.xml?uid=960019894
     
Will it be possible to search by grade percentages, i.e. "<50% final" or "no oral presentation" or ">60% papers"?  Even if this
    just worked for finals, midterms, and papers, this would be /SUPER/ cool.  Some courses don't include this data, so they could
    just be ignored for this type of searches.
    
/-----COMPLETED--------/
**Should not be able to spam requests if search hasn't changed**
**AHH SAME SCROLLING BUG WITH THE GRADIENT FIX THIS NAUWGH!!!**
**Can we make it so that if there is only one search result (especially if I search for a specific course, e.g. "COS 333"), it gets opened up on the right side automatically?**
**Still not scraping all courses** We are now!
Search by grading option
Show crosslistings in results list
When I remove a course from my cart, two remove requests are sent. What's up with that?
**Put pdf options in Advanced Search**
Include class number. The thing you need to enter on SCORE to find the stupid course.
** Hey Natalie, I really like how COM 318 looks, specially that little question mark in Bola?o that's in the
database. Good job!**
