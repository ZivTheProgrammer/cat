This is just a file of stuff we think about that needs to be done. These are mostly little things that anyone
could do in their spare time:

/--------BUGS----------/

**Still not scraping all courses**

**Scraping formats for distribution requirements and pdf stuff. So far, "na, npdf" doesn't seem to work.**

**See folder cat/bugScreenshots for screenshots of bugs that need to be fixed. If fixed, don't delete the files, just note that it's resolved in the README**

**FOR TESTING REVIEWS**
There's a freaky review for AAS 201, from 2006 for Robert Fredin, that's just "aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa" and it makes ICE look pretty bad.

/------Features--------/
I'm pretty sure a course can satisfy multiple distribution requirements.
  Are we returning a list for that? How's that working? It looks like the 
  Django code only checks for one, but I could be reading it wrong.

What about this thing that appears on some courses?
     ENROLLMENT BY APPLICATION OR INTERVIEW. DEPARTMENTAL PERMISSION REQUIRED.

The courses that are returned from the search need to be sorted.  If we want to be like the registrar, they should 
be sorted first be subject, e.g. COS, and then stably sorted by number, e.g. 109. 

Searching for "no pdf" "not pdfable" "not pdf-able" "pdf only" "pdfonly" and "nopdf" should all work as
    expected.  Now only "no-pdf" and "pdf-only" work.
    
Should searching for "pdf" return pdf-only courses or all courses that are pdf-able (i.e. most courses)

Searching by time should work.  Question: If a user searches an hour, say "11:00" or "11am" or "11AM" or "11:00 am" etc., should the search should return all classes that start anytime within that hour, or only classes that start exactly at that time?
--Any time within that hour. That's what the Registrar does.

Distinguish between professors and preceptors. (This is a scraping issue first, then a display issue.)

Database scraping: a few classes aren't getting added for some reason. In particular, CBE 504 (and a few others) for term 1132.

/------Feepers---------/
Need to format detail view and make it include:
   Links from professor names to contact info, eg:
   	 http://registrar.princeton.edu/course-offerings/dirinfo.xml?uid=960019894
     
Will it be possible to search by grade percentages, i.e. "<50% final" or "no oral presentation" or ">60% papers"?  Even if this
    just worked for finals, midterms, and papers, this would be /SUPER/ cool.  Some courses don't include this data, so they could
    just be ignored for this type of searches.
