This is just a file of stuff we think about that needs to be done. These are mostly little things that anyone
could do in their spare time:

Need to format detail view and make it include:
   Sample Reading List:
   Reading/Writing assignments:
   Requirements/Grading:
   Other Requirements:
   Links from professor names to contact info, eg:
   	 http://registrar.princeton.edu/course-offerings/dirinfo.xml?uid=960019894

  Are we returning a list for that? How's that working? It looks like the 
  Django code only checks for one, but I could be reading it wrong.

What about this thing that appears on some courses?
     ENROLLMENT BY APPLICATION OR INTERVIEW. DEPARTMENTAL PERMISSION REQUIRED.
