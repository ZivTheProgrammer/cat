To have git remember your credentials so you don't have to enter them every time you push, run this command:

git alias.authcache "config --global credential.helper 'cache --timeout 3600'"

Then, if you want it to remember your credentials, type

git authcache

And you will only have to enter your credentials the next time you push, subsequent times will remember your credentials. As written above it expires after 1 hour, if you want it to be longer, change the "3600" to however long you want it to remember, in seconds.

This is a change I made to see if it works!!
